# About

[TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org) plugin to enforce the use of the `@name` tag to
declare entity names.

Any entity with a jsDoc comment containing a `@name` tag with a valid value
will be named like that by TypeDoc instead of using the original entity name.

For example, the following class declares a an event member which, thanks to this
plugin will be named `before:add-to-cart`. Without this plugin TypeDoc will name
the event like the method, `addListener`. The method signature will still be used
for the event, the only thing that change is its name.

```ts
export interface Cart {
  /**
   * Register given listener function to be notified when the user add the items to the cart
   * @event
   * @name before:add-to-cart
   * @param listener accepts the items that the user had intention to add to the cart and
   * a promise that will be resolved when the transaction is fulfilled or rejected
   * otherwise. Also the listener have the possibility to asynchronously validate
   * the transaction yb returning a promise. If so the transaction won't start
   * unless the promise is resolved (could be useful to validate with third parties
   * providers)
   */
  addListener(
    listener: (
      items: IItem[],
      transaction: Promise<ITransaction>
    ) => Promise<boolean>
  ): void;
}
```

# Usage

```sh
npm install --save-dev typedoc-plugin-respect-name-tag
```

Typedoc has the ability to discover and load typedoc plugins found in node_modules. Simply install the plugin and run typedoc.

```
npm install --save typedoc-plugin-external-module-name
typedoc
```

If unsure, you can always run typedoc with `--plugin typedoc-plugin-respect-name-tag` argument to enforce plugin's execution.

# TODO:

- test not only for events but for clases, properties, etc
- validate @name's value - should be valid ts identifier.
